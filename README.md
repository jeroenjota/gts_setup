# gts_setup
Starting to build GTS, a golf tournament system

I have built this program in VB6 over the past few years.

I am using this project to learn web (app) development, coming from VB6, please be patient ;-))

The system should allow members to 
- create golf tournaments
- enter participants for a golf tournament
- select one or more courses for the event
- add/edit courses in the database
- enter participants results
- process reports
- and maybe more...
